# Sales of Honey in the United States – Data Analysis

**Author:** Manan Verma  
**Project Type:** Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes honey production and sales data across different states in the United States. The analysis focuses on understanding state-wise production, stock levels, pricing trends, and overall value of production over multiple years.

## Objective
- Analyze honey production data across US states
- Compare production, stocks, and pricing state-wise
- Identify top and bottom producing states
- Extract insights to understand regional honey production trends

## Dataset
**US Honey Production Dataset**

### Dataset Features
- `state` – US state name
- `colonies_number` – Number of bee colonies
- `yield_per_colony` – Honey yield per colony
- `production` – Total honey production
- `stocks` – Honey stocks
- `average_price` – Average price of honey
- `value_of_production` – Total value of production
- `year` – Year of record

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis Performed

### 1. Data Inspection
- Checked dataset shape and structure
- Verified data types and non-null values

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Verified absence of missing values
- Removed unnecessary index column

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
- State-wise honey production analysis
- Visualization using bar plots
- Grouped data by state to calculate total production

### 4. Comparative Analysis
- Identified **top 5 honey-producing states**
- Compared production trends across regions
- Analyzed pricing and value of production

## Key Insights
- **North Dakota is the highest honey-producing state**[web:1][web:2]
- **California and South Dakota** also contribute significantly to total production
- Honey production is **highly concentrated** in a few states
- **Pricing and production volume vary significantly** across regions
